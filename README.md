# gym_rem2D
OpenAI gym environment for evolving morphologies of 2D virtual creatures. 

Note that at this stage the code still needs some cleaning. (You will also find some hardcoded hacks in there) It should be straightforward to install the requirements and run the Demo.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like some explanation or have a suggestion.
