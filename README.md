# gym_rem2D : MAP-Elites Branch
Box 2D environment for evolving morphologies of 2D virtual creatures. 

## MAP-Elites branch

 This branch of the repository contains a MAP-Elites implementation. This implementation was used for the master thesis of Martin Herring Olsen that can be found at https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/91265/1/Thesis.pdf .

### Study summary
This branch explored how branch was used for a comparative study investigating MAP-Elites and a standard evolutionary algorithm, and a direct and indirect encoding, when evolving 2D virtual creatures. Our main finding was that although MAP-Elites finds a more diverse set of solutions than the general EA, the encoding had more of an effect on finding individuals that performed well. Although further research is needed, we see a trend that combining QD-algorithms with a good genetic representation is useful for effectively evolving well-performing individuals.
